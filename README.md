# The-Way-To-Go

Go, whose authentic name is [Go](https://go.dev/doc/faq#go_or_golang) (though the moniker "Golang" is conveniently used), came into existence due to exasperation with prevailing languages and frameworks utilized within Google. Without delving into the exhaustive introductory details, let's swiftly move past those preliminaries. If you're perusing this, chances are you possess a reasonable understanding of Go; however, if that's not the case, I recommend investing around 20 minutes in online research before returning here, as this article holds substantial importance for you. Moreover, I'll dispense with formalities and dive straight into the heart of the matter, opting for a conversational tone. Your continued readership is greatly appreciated.

## First Recommendation: "Learning Go"

Authored by Joe Bodner, if you're delving into Go for the very first time, "Learning Go" should be your initial port of call. Allow me to emphasize this with conviction. Choosing this book will be a decision you won't rue; I wholeheartedly endorse it—indeed, I can't stress it enough. While an alternative option often referred to as the "Go Bible" exists (depicted by the smaller image below), it's important to note that not only is that book dated, but, in my perspective, it's better suited for individuals arriving with a wealth of programming experience, particularly with languages such as C, C++, or Java.

In my personal journey, transitioning from languages like Python and JavaScript, I fervently advocate for "Learning Go" over the aforementioned alternative. Allow me to refrain from further hammering the point, but to alleviate any wavering doubts, I reiterate: "Learning Go" is undeniably the path to tread. Not only does it present the language in a lucid manner, but it also imparts the idiomatic approach to coding—precisely how to proficiently craft code akin to an industry expert. Spare yourself the ordeal of, like myself, sifting through various literary sources. Trust me, don't. Begin with this book, it is "the-way-to-Go".

## Second Recommendation: "Let Go"

Go shines unmistakably as the go-to choice for constructing backend systems—ranging from elementary webservers to expansive, intricate microservices (particularly the latter). Hence, it's judicious to envision yourself as a backend engineer when venturing into the realm of Go. Assuming you've delved into at least 8 chapters of "Learning Go," the next logical step is "Let's Go," the paramount guide to initiating your journey into building Go-based webservers.

Allow me to emphasize the sheer excellence of this book. Not only does it facilitate the creation of backend systems using Go, but its methodologies are profoundly applicable within the industry landscape. The resonance between its teachings and industry standards is nothing short of remarkable.The book stayed off frameworks and kept with libraries as recommednded by most Gophers.

While other options exist, I implore you with the utmost sincerity, select "Let's Go." I assure you, the decision will be void of regrets. Authored by Alex Edwards.

## Third Recommendation: "Powerful Command-Line Applications In Go"

Authored by Ricardo Gerardi, the second most prevalent utilization of Go lies in crafting command-line applications and various forms of tooling. This book adeptly delivers simplicity, conciseness, and efficiency adhering to industry standards. Notably, the book goes above and beyond in its approach to acquainting readers with the language. Thus, comprehending the content poses no significant challenge.

However, what I find particularly captivating and immensely valuable within its pages is the extensive integration of testing. Trust me, testing holds paramount significance in the realm of Go, underscoring its status as a professional-grade language.

While alternative learning resources for Go-based command-line interfaces exist, I wholeheartedly vouch for this book based on my extensive readings. If you're embarking on your Go journey and seek a comprehensive exploration of command-line intricacies, all conveniently bundled within a single source, this book stands unparalleled. Although I might entertain the notion of interchanging its ranking with "Let's Go," I recommend reserving this book as the third resource to explore.

## Fourth Recommendation: "Let Go Further"
